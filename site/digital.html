I was brought on to create a set of animated digital porthole views of space outside and a cinematic flight animation going from space to surface of a planet.</p>
<p>The challenge of any business is iteration speed. Whether you're creating futuristic entertainment, SaaS or even sell "Analogue Services", one of your constraints will always be how fast you can create outputs to assess your inputs to make better decisions every time you iterate.</p>
<p>Unity engine was the authoring environment which allowed me to bring together a variety of manually sculpted, pre-rendered, procedurally generated, scripted, kit-bashed and AI assisted assets, along with my realtime lighting, shading and graphics pipeline expertise. It enabled framing, animation, lighting, keying and physics simulations to happen in real-time.</p>
<p>If you don't have to wait seconds and minutes or hours to see what changes you just made, you can validate your decisions faster, allowing more time to be spent on style discovery, refinement and detailing.</p>

Part of the channel's style is animated cartoons of their main character depicted as a brain. To suit their 2D workflow using AfterEffects, I created a 3D model for their new logo and made a utility that could render it out from any angle.</p></section><section><h2><a id='friendship_is_magic' href=friendship_is_magic.html>Friendship Is Magic</a></h2><p><img src='../content/images/FriendShipIsMagicPonyVille.webp' loading='lazy'></p><p>While at Gameloft as a Technical Artist, I helped release the official My Little Pony village building game for iOS using Gameloft's in-house engine and tooling.

I was a Lead Artist on the self-titled project, a realtime 3D online web platform and meeting tool.</p>
<p>Remotely was built using Unity3D and deployed on the web using WebGL. It was a challenging project from a technical perspective. Unity's WebGL deployment was buggy and underdeveloped at the time and there were huge compatibility and optimizations issues across platforms and browsers.</p>

<p>Gaea calendar starts with your birth timestamp in Gregorean format and moves in sync with the Earth from then. Each Gaea day corresponds to 1 angular degree around the Sun.</p>
<p>A year has <strong>12 months &amp; 30 days</strong> each and as such, doesn't respect Gregorean calendar days and is out of phase with regular day/night cycles. There are no hours or minutes in Gaea, a day lasts <code>360</code> units, which is equal to <code>87661536</code> milliseconds. Year index is zero-based.</p>
