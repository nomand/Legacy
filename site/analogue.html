These projects may involve computers in some way, but their final manifistation is corporial and physical.</p></section><section><h2><a id='merlin_fob' href=merlin_fob.html>Merlin Fob</a></h2><p><img src='../content/images/MerlinFobCloseup.webp' loading='lazy'></p><p>I was tasked with fabricating a replacement housing for Merlin M842 remote control for a garage door. Given that the device is most commonly carried on a key chain or thrashed around in a car glovebox, the housing ends up taking a beating with age and a replacement can cost as much as $60 to $90. My goal was to create a competent replacement that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>be user serviceable (accessible battery compartment)</li>
<li>have the led indicator visible</li>
<li>have a slimmer profile than the original</li>
<li>be easy to manufacture using a hobby grade FDM 3D printer</li>
<li>Didn’t take too long to design or print</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Broken pieces of an old garage remote." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/MerlinFobOldHousing.webp" /></p>
<p>The circuit board of the remote is a circle, the battery is centered on the back and the buttons are simple printed contacts that get shorted by the rubber buttons. The original rubber buttons were ripped and I ended up salvaging buttons from a calculator that had conductive carbon coating on the bottom.</p>
<p>My design essentially boiled down to two components – the “housing” that’s the main body holding all the components and has the keychain loop, and the “cap” that holds the battery in place.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a 3D CAD model for new garage remote housing." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/MerlinFobCad.webp" /></p>
<p>The design went through 6 iterations on the main body and 3 iterations on the cap. To further “slim down” the profile I made the cap have rounded edges to give a thinner feel to the whole assembly.</p>
<p>Getting the circuit to sit right in the housing was easy, the circuit is pretty symmetrical and key components sit at neat 45 degree angles to everything. The main challenge was to get the tolerances right on the cap for the battery to be centered on the power connector. The led indicator is simply hot glue melted through a hole in the housing.
The circuit board had two convenient holes for me to thread screws through to avoid having to design a locking mechanism.</p>
<p><img alt="3D printed and assembled garage remote in hand. Open and Close buttons are ON/C and MRC buttons from a calculator." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/MerlinFobAssembled.webp" /></p>
<p>While the calculator buttons look funky and unique, I would ultimately prefer for the buttons to be hidden under the housing. They’re too easy to press accidentally or pull the rubber out of the housing. The best alternative would be to solder in some low profile hardware buttons and use the flexibility of the housing to press them through the plastic.</p>
<p>If you own one of these fobs and yours is falling apart, feel free to download the files and print them on your own. There’s no guarantee that the buttons that you will use be of the same dimensions, so I provided a version with the center point of the buttons for you to cut away (physically or digitally) as much material as you need for the buttons you’ll end up using.</p>

I've spent countless hours playing Link to the Past and F-Zero under poorly lit conditions in my teenage years.</p>
<p>I've had this gameboy since I was 15 and I decided to give it a facelift with a custom aftermarket shell, glass screen cover and a backlit screen it deserved from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The backlit screens used to be rare and had to be harvested from a specific model of a GBSP, but now freely available from China. Thanks to this modding guide by <a href="https://circuit-board.de/forum/index.php/Thread/9546-UR-GBA-Backlight-Screen-Mod-AGS-101-Display/?postID=593388#post593388" target="_blank">gaggi</a> GBA's motherboard can display a vivid and clear image.</p>

Irefurbished it with a new handle as a small DIY project.</p>
<p>The handle was completely scorched, but the steel was great quality and in good condition for its age.
Initially I wanted to make the handle from laminated structural timber, to have the layers show through once sanded, butit was too tough to carve with a knife, and I decided to use softer wood from a window trim.</p>
<p><img alt="Knife blade without handle next to a block of wood and a drill bit." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/SheffieldKnifeSteel.webp" />
<img alt="Knife with a rough cut of a new handle on a wooden surface with wood chips next to it." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/SheffieldKnifeHandleRaw.webp" /></p>
<p>I don’t really know what type of wood it was, but it’s light and very soft. After some drilling, shaving and sanding, thehandle was pleasant to hold.
I applied a coat of vinegar and iron rust mix to blacken the handle, with a top coat of linseed oil to prevent mold andgive it some water resistance.</p>

<h1 id="guide">Guide</h1>
<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<p>Remove the SMA cover and the retaining brass nut.</p>
<p><img alt="EachineVR006 FPV Headset." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR02.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Underneath, unscrew 4 phillips screws and lift the top half of the plastic body.</p>
<p><img alt="Bottom of the fpv headset." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR03.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>The battery is held in place with a piece of foam and double sticky tape. Remove the foam and carefully cut along the tape with a craft knife to avoid prying the lipo battery.
Remove the control board and the fresnel lens. The screen assembly should freely slide out of the housing.</p>
<p><img alt="Inside of the FPV headset. LCD Display and fresnel lens." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR04.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>
<p>Be careful removing the screen, as it's not attached to the circuit board. Pull them gently together to avoid damaging the ribbon cable.</p>
<p><img alt="Electrical components of the headset laid out on a table." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR05.webp" /></p>
<p>There are two variants of this board - the "diversity" version with two antennas (not real RX diversity) and the single antenna version I have here, my case design is for this version.</p>
<p><img alt="Back of the motherboard with radio reciever visible." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR06.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-5">Step 5</h3>
<p>Next, you'll tape up the exposed breakout pins to avoid short circuiting them when you secure the screen to the surface (the back of the LCD is metal).</p>
<p><img alt="Other side of the motherboard, flat surface with no smd components." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR07.webp" /></p>
<p>Cut some pieces of electrical tape to cover the breakout pins and gently press the screen onto the board to secure it with double sticky tape.
Use double sided tape, foam tape will make the assembly too thick.</p>
<p><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="../content/images/eachinevr_08.jpg" /></p>
<h3 id="step-6">Step 6</h3>
<p>Navigate to <a href="/STL/.html">/STL/</a>, download and 3D print the housing.</p>
<p><img alt="CAD render of the new shell." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR09.webp" /></p>
<p><img alt="CAD render of the rear lid of the shell." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR10.webp" /></p>
<p>I created this to fit on a 10x10 printing platform, which is common among lowest-end printers. Due to this, the USB charging port sticks out a bit. If you want to make it flush with the side of the case, simply extrude the right wall by 3mm to the left.</p>
<h3 id="step-7">Step 7</h3>
<p>Remove the metal frame from the LCD panel. It will only get caught in the ridges of the 3D print and may actually damage your screen.</p>
<p><img alt="Display with it's frame removed." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR10.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-8">Step 8</h3>
<p>Slot the assembly into the body of the case, ribbon cable side first, carefully allowing the case to bend it over the edge.</p>
<p><img alt="Motherboard fit into the new 3D printed case." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR12.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-9">Step 9</h3>
<p>De-solder the connector from the control board and re-attach the cables in order for the buttons to fit into the rear panel holes. Make sure to note which cable goes where, they're both black.</p>
<p><img alt="The control buttons circuit with connector removed next to pliers." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR13.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-10">Step 10</h3>
<p>Add some foam padding to the motherboard to sit against the control board to prevent it from sinking into the case when pressing the buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="Buttons circuit fitted to the rear lid 3D print." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR14.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="step-11">Step 11</h3>
<p>Slot the rear cover into the bottom rail, aligning the top rail gaps then push it in to mesh both rails and slide the cover on.</p>
<p><img alt="Rear lid assembly to the main 3D printed body." loading="lazy" src="../content/images/EachineVR15.webp" /></p>
<h3 id="done">Done!</h3>
<p>Your screen assembly is now complete! Happy flying!</p>
