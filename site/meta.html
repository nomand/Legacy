Designed to convert a folder hierarchy with .txt files written in Markdown with custom metadata and custom link parsers to a cross-linked wiki html site.</p>
<p>Design philosophy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source content is plain text, markdown formatted and readable outside of html renderer.</li>
<li>Source folder structure reflects output page hierarchy.</li>
<li>Plain static html, no databases or javascript required.</li>
<li>Plain root output retains urls so that individual page relationships can change.</li>
<li>Changes over time can be tracked using <a href="https://github.com/nomand/Legacy/commits/master" target="_blank">github commit tree</a></li>
