I picked up an early 1900’s English butter knife from an op shop, which had a bone handle that was completely burnt. Irefurbished it with a new handle as a small DIY project.

The handle was completely scorched, but the steel was great quality and in good condition for its age.
Initially I wanted to make the handle from laminated structural timber, to have the layers show through once sanded, butit was too tough to carve with a knife, and I decided to use softer wood from a window trim.

I don’t really know what type of wood it was, but it’s light and very soft. After some drilling, shaving and sanding, thehandle was pleasant to hold.
I applied a coat of vinegar and iron rust mix to blacken the handle, with a top coat of linseed oil to prevent mold andgive it some water resistance.
