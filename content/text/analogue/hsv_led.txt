An arduino controlled light strip for my former workspace. It used off the shelf components, 3D-printed and lazer-cut parts. It had 3 knobs that controlled color and brightness using HSV mapping.
Code and STL files available on the project [github](https://github.com/nomand/HSVStripController) page.

#### Parts

* P9813 LED controller
* 1x Arduino nano
* 3x Analogue Pots
* 1x 5v or 3.3v (depending on your Arduino) Voltage regulator
* 1x 12v power input jack
* 1x 3D printed shell
* 1x Lazer cut faceplate

#### Dependancies:

* [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) Library
* [ResponsiveAnalogRead](https://github.com/dxinteractive/ResponsiveAnalogRead) Library
* [ArduinoAnalogueSmooth](https://github.com/MichaelThessel/arduino-analog-smooth) Library

I had particularly low quality potentiometers, so the signal is over-filtered. I would use digital rotary encoders if I were to improve it.
