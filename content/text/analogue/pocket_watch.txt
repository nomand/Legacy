Breathing life into an old British pocket watch. Picked up at a Rotorua antique store, it came with a broken spring. A watch is a beautiful machine. It's amazing that centuries ago we figured out how to release spring tension in measured intervals that can be synced up with rotation of the [Earth](Gaea).

This is a visual archive of the repair process.
