Irie is a 33ft steel sailboat that is my home, my workspace and my playground. It's the biggest project I've ever undertaken, the biggest object I own and marks the most exciting and challenging arc of my life.

In 2021 I bought Irie with intention to move aboard and forego the common formula for life and take on a cruising lifestyle.

I moved aboard in 2022 with my partner. Currently undertaking necessary repairs and upgrades to sail around New Zealand in 2023.

This process will be documented in a sister-wiki dedicated to the journey.
