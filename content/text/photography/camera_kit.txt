## Digital

There is no point in a camera that you don't have with you. And while phones can sometimes be "good enough", you can't cheat physics. I prefer to bring a mirrorless that I could easily carry in my hand on a multi-hour hike, over a heavy DSLR that stays in a backpack or at home.

I used to shoot exclusively using prime lenses for their portability and significant weight reduction. Since purchasing an E PZ 18-105mm f/4 G OSS, it's become my exclusive lens for it's versatility. It compromises portability, but wins out not having to carry separate lenses and swap them around.

_"They don't make them like they're used to"_. And this one is one of the most beautiful cameras ever made. Often comes bundled with a Zuiko 50mm f2.8, but get the f1.4 if you can find one.
