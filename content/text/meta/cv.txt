I'm a technologist, balancing my creative practices between software, hardware, digital and analogue.

Currently doing research in Stable Diffusion workflow design and AI pipelines for generative content authoring. Talk to me if you want to learn more about AI art pipelines and how you can leverage Open Source technologies of this domain at your business.

I specialize in interactive applications, video games and digital media. I facilitate R&D, design, prototyping, development, user experience research, consulting and project management.

I have experience with with VR and mobile application development, while primarily working in Unity game engine, doing everything from 2D/3D art and design, animation, motion tracking, motion control, shaders, sound design, music production and tool development.

I have experience prototyping with IoT hardware such as Raspberry Pi, arduino and ESP32 and UAV drone technology. I've done CAD and small run manufacturing using CNC machines, working with wood, metal and carbon fibre.

I've been involved in a number of social media campaigns for past projects, front-end web development, photography, podcasting, video production for interviews, video game trailers and youtube format content.

I'm interested working with companies that aren't shy to invest in unknown futures and support R&D efforts to open new business opportunities.
