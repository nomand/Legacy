Legacy is a wiki-like static site generator written in Python.
Designed to convert a folder hierarchy with .txt files written in Markdown with custom metadata and custom link parsers to a cross-linked wiki html site.

Design philosophy:

* Source content is plain text, markdown formatted and readable outside of html renderer.
* Source folder structure reflects output page hierarchy.
* Plain static html, no databases or javascript required.
* Plain root output retains urls so that individual page relationships can change.
* Changes over time can be tracked using [github commit tree](https://github.com/nomand/Legacy/commits/master)
