I was a Technical Artist at Zero King, a studio with their first self-titled online competitive space shooter [Zero King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2675370/Zero_King/)

I was responsible for defining the early alpha stage visual design and realtime rendering techniques, visual effects and environment lighting for combat alpha.
Zero King was build using Unity3D engine, using Universal Rendering Pipeline during my tenure.
