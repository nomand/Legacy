Swordy is a local-multiplayer physics based brawler, A game I worked on as part of an indie studio I co-founded called (frogshark)[frogshark].
I was involved from conception in 2014 until late 2016, responsible for some 3D and technical art, level design, sound design, dynamic soundtrack, marketing materials, video editing among other things.

It was made available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/467900/SWORDY/) Early Access, but is not finished, nor  supported since the dissolution of the indie studio.
