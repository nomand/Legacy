Motion controlled, Xbox Kinect driven audiovisual installation created as a collaboration with [Digital Art Live](https://www.aucklandlive.co.nz/digital-art-live) during my Masters of Creative Technologies study.

Vizcera was on display at Aotea Centre in November 2014. A video of it in action can be seen [here](https://vimeo.com/118676473).
