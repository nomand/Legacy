Experimental planetary birthday clock.

Gaea calendar starts with your birth timestamp in Gregorean format and moves in sync with the Earth from then. Each Gaea day corresponds to 1 angular degree around the Sun.

A year has **12 months & 30 days** each and as such, doesn't respect Gregorean calendar days and is out of phase with regular day/night cycles. There are no hours or minutes in Gaea, a day lasts `360` units, which is equal to `87661536` milliseconds. Year index is zero-based.
