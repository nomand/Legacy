DK1 Oculus VR Jam.
In 2013, Oculus held a gamejam for developers who owned the very first Oculus DK1 from Kickstarter. My friend [Hamish](https://kor.nz/) and I submitted a head-aiming space shooter demo called Warp. It was showcased at DigitalNatioNZ expo in 2013.

These events contributed towards what evolved to become [frogshark](frogshark).
