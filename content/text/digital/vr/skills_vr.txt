From 2019 to 2020, I worked as an Art Lead at what was then called [Joy Business Academy](https://skillsvr.com). I was overseeing the art team across all projects, with main hands-on focus on the new at the time VR initiative.

We were developing a learning platform with a series of networked multiplayer learning-and-assessment experiences that were kickstarted by the [Ministry of Social Development](https://www.msd.govt.nz/).

I was responsible for creating and maintaining an art style, workflow pipelines and tooling to deliver performant standalone VR experiences on the Oculus Quest 1 headset.
