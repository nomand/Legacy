This shader demonstrates a method of using worldspace transforms (relative positions, scale and rotation) to remap texture UV's in XZ world axis. The technique can be used to create variety of shader effects.
Example supplied uses a heightmap projection for vertex offset. Creted using Amplify Shader Editor.
