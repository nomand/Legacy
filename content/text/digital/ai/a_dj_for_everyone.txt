**There's a DJ for Everyone** is an AI animation experiment.

It utilizes Stable Diffusion, IPAdapter, AnimateDiff models along with various upscalers and interpolators to achieve a set of psychedelic morphing loops that explore a variety of visual and music styles.

In 2025, I exhibited a 25 minute version of this work at Dimension Festival in 2025. It seamlessly morphed between 50 different characters.

Some of the individual animations can be seen on the project [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@sreflab)
