I take huge interest in AI. I still cannot believe that the renaissance is happening in our lifetimes.  
I took big interest in Stable Diffusion because of the toolset's ability to steer image generation and have incredible level of control over results.  
I work using ComfyUI toolset, developing workflows and experimenting deeply with tuneability of the system and how to get creative and deliberate outputs.
